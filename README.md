 Within this repository there are exmaples of YAML files I have created for Azure DevOps Pipelines, in practise the windows application yaml file has been split into 3 templates which are then referenced for each module require (there are 25).
 
 There are varieties of each of these pipelines currently in use for different situations such as builds where NuGets are unwanted, where specfiic test environments are required and for different output depending on whether it is a production, release candiate or release branch build.
